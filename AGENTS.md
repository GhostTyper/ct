# Code Style

* Please use native datatypes and don't use var. (Use int instead of Int32, Long instead of Int64, etc.)
* Codebase is .NET 8.0.
* Always end commit messages with a period so they read as full sentences.
* Don't use auto-properties. Use a private variable which is just accessed by the Getter, if you need a public readonly Propoerty/Field, whatever.
